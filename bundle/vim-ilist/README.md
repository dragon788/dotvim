# vim-ilist

Vim-ilist is an updated, more powerful, version of the function discussed in [this /r/vim thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1rzvsm/do_any_of_you_redirect_results_of_i_to_the/).

The purpose of this script is to make the results of `]I`, `[I`, `]D`, `[D`, `:ilist` and `:dlist` easier to navigate and more persistant by using the quickfix window instead of the default list-like interface.

## Possible developments

* Add proper documentation.
* Add a gifcast to the `README`.
* Add options.
